# SharpTracker

A noob's attempt at making a Tracker-style Digital Audio Workstation using multi-platform .Net 

Plan:

1. Muck about with Avalonia (https://avaloniaui.net/GettingStarted) to make something resembling a vertical list with some buttons
2. Try generating a sine wave with NAudio
3. Sine wave at different notes
4. Note data in list

LATER...

* Controller support
* Basic persistence
* Implement basic MIDI support
* Implement VST support (VST2 and VST3, probably x64 only)
* Check out ReactiveUI (https://www.reactiveui.net) to see if it makes sense to include/refactor into
* Support for some common tracker mod file formats
